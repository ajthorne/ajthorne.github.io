        Hi! I'm Amanda Thorne, a front end developer currently residing in Austin, Texas.
        </p>
        <ul className="about-holder">
          <li className="about-item">
            <p>I was born in Pennsylvania and moved to Austin four years ago in pursuit of better weather. I'm a recent graduate from The Iron Yard 12 week immersive program where I learn to code in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, along with various frameworks such as React.js, Backbone.js, jQuery, and more. I'm a lover of movies, cats, and sand between my toes.</p>

            <h3>Where I've been</h3>
            <p>My background is in education. I spent eight years as a middle school teacher before deciding to change my career. I attended graduate school at Columbia University, where I earned a Master of Arts degree in Literacy. I made the decision to switch careers to web development because I wanted to return to my roots of creativity and building useful resources and tools. Currently, I'm enamored with building whatever I can in JavaScript and exploring various frameworks.</p>

          <li className="about-item">
            <h3>What I Hope To Do</h3>
            <p>I'm seeking a full time Front End Development role currently. My ultimate goal is to work and design education software that helps improve the lives of our youth.</p>
