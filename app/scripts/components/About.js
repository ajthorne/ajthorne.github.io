        Hi! I'm Amanda Thorne, a front end developer currently residing in Austin, Texas.

        <li className="about-item">
          <h3>Who Am I</h3>
          <p>I was born in Pennsylvania and moved to Austin four years ago in pursuit of better weather. I'm a recent graduate from The Iron Yard 12 week immersive program where I learn to code in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, along with using various frameworks such as React.js, Backbone.js, jQuery, and more. I'm a lover of movies, cats, and sand between my toes.</p>
        </li>
        <li className="about-item">
          <h3>Where I've been</h3>
          <p>My background is in education. I spent eight years as a middle school teacher before deciding to change my career. I made the decision to switch careers to web development because I wanted to return to my roots of creativity and building useful resources and tools. Currently, I'm enamored with building whatever I can in JavaScript and exploring various frameworks.</p>
        </li>
        <li className="about-item">
          <h3>What I Hope To Do</h3>
          <p>I'm seeking a full time Front End Development role currently. I value hard work, dedication, and being passionate in whatever you do in life. I desire to be part of a team that values these things as well. My ultimate goal is to work and design education software that helps improve the lives of our youth.</p>
